<p><font size="6">There are lot of people who does not recognize food ingrediants and have no idea about what to cook with the items they are left with . So we propose an idea to solve there problem. We develop a web app which involves machine Learning .
    This app scans the items, recognizes them and display there names and then it prompts the user whether to add the item to the list of ingrediants.
    In such way user scans all the items he want to recognize and adds all the items to the list.
    Then when the user is done adding the items the application suggests him with all the food recepies that he can cook with the available items.
    And in case if the items are short to prepare a food then the application suggests the user with minimum quantity of items that he can get to cook a food item.
